<p>Dedicated to engineering solutions that effectively address the complexities of digital commerce. 💼 As an Engineer, I relish the challenges of problem-solving and am fueled by continuous exploration. 🚀 A passionate learner at heart, I find solace in exploring spiritual and philosophical realms, fostering a holistic approach to growth. 🌱 Data excites me, and I thrive on delving into its intricacies to uncover insights. With a solid understanding of SQL, I navigate databases with ease to extract valuable information. 💾 With over 4 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in Front-end JS technologies and back-end solutions leveraging Python, .NET, and Java. 💻 My journey has exposed me to the intricacies of AWS cloud technologies, igniting a passion for AI, ML, and the evolving landscape of generative AI. 🧠 Additionally, I harbor a keen interest in the commerce domain and the digital landscape of India 🇮🇳, fascinated by its potential to drive societal transformation. Let's connect to explore new opportunities together! 🌟</p>
